# CNN from Scratch

Accompanying code of the "Convolutional Neural Network from Scratch" article in my blog. You can find both English and Spanish versions here:

- [English](http://datasmarts.net/convolutional-neural-network-from-scratch/).
- [Spanish](https://datasmarts.net/es/redes-neuronales-convolucionales-desde-cero./).

The notebooks in this repository are based on the assignments of the fourth course in [deeplearning.ai's specialization on Coursera](https://es.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).

## Getting started

First, you'll need `conda`. Then, create the environment with the following command:

```
conda create -n cnn-from-scratch python=3.6
```

Activate the environment:

```
source activate cnn-from-scratch
```

Finally, install the requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Interact with the notebooks

Once in the conda environment, run:

```
jupyter notebook
```
